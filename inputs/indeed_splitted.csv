The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.    At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.    We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.    This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.    Summary    OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.    The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.    OXMAN does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or any other legally protected characteristics.

However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.    One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.       - come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.    - are allergic to over-engineering.    - are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.    - are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.    - are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.    - have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).       - push the limits of cutting-edge computing and machine learning    - build the team and drive the direction of the company.    - shape our product and culture.    - experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.       - fluency in Python, Rust and PyTorch    - experience with training and deploying models in multi-GPU environments    - recognized open-source contributions    - participation in competitive programming events (CTFs, Putnam, IOI, IMO, IPHO, Topcoder, Kaggle, etc.)          We are fully remote, with a virtual base in New York, US.

The CDF connects all IC data providers and consumers. It uses fully automated policy-based access controls to create a machine-to-machine data brokerage service, which is enabling the transition away from legacy point-to-point solutions across the IC enterprise. We were founded as a fresh alternative in the Government Consulting Community and are dedicated to the belief that results are a product of analytical thinking, agile design principles and that solutions are built in collaboration with, not for, our customers. This mantra drives us to succeed and act as true partners in advancing our client’s missions. The CDF program is an evolution for the way DoD programs, services, and combat support agencies access data by providing data consumers (e.g., systems, app developers, etc.) with a “one-stop shop” for obtaining ISR data. The CDF significantly increases the DI2E’s ability to meet the ISR needs of joint and combined task force commanders by providing enterprise data at scale. The CDF serves as the scalable, modular, open architecture that enables interoperability for the collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination, and archiving of all forms and formats of intelligence data. Through the CDF, programs can easily share data and access new sources using their existing architecture. The CDF is a network and end-user agnostic capability that enables enterprise intelligence data sharing from sensor tasking to product dissemination.  Primary responsibility is to work with data providers within the IC and DoD Enterprise to identify and ingest data sets into the CDF data broker.
